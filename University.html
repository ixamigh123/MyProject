  <h3 style="text-align:center;">..and here I am, UiTM!</h3>
  <p>As soon as I finished school, I intended to continue my studies at university. Initially, I applied to continue 
      my studies at the diploma level but my application was rejected for reasons I do not know. 
      Therefore, I continued my studies at UiTM Alor Gajah Campus in Melaka under the Pre-Diploma 
      program for six months. There I learned many things as a student and as a teenager growing up. 
      After finishing my studies there, I continued my studies at the diploma level under the Information Management course. 
      I who have to be in semester 5 is close to graduating as this course only has 5 semesters of learning 
      sessions and does not require practical learning or known as internship.</p>

  <p>UiTM Rembau: During my time here, I've gone through a lot. Friendships were lost, there was no money to eat, there was 
      no progress on assignments, and there was a full schedule. But, more importantly, a lot of nice things happen while I'm here. 
      I know what it's like to be a true friend, to interact, to learn to accept, to know when to give up, to know how to control my 
      emotion around toxic people, to know how to ignore and avoid them and create new memories just with everyone in the circle. 
      I am 6518 sorry and thank you for everything.</p>
