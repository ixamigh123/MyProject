  <h3 style="text-align:center;">My Journey in Primary Schools</h3>
  <p>When I was 5 years old, my mother had sent me to the village to live with my grandparent. 
      After I entered the age of 6, I was sent to school at Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan (Felda) Pasoh 2. 
      Starting from Pre-school I studied there until I was in grade 4, when I was 10 years old. 
      There, I was always among the top 3 best students in the academy field in my batch. 
      I am also not left behind in sports, I am an athlete and my favorite events are 100m sprint, 4x100m relay and long jump. 
      After that, I moved back to live with my mother and sister in Klang, Selangor. 
      Here, I went to school at Kampung Idaman Primary School. 
      But unfortunately, I have started to get complacent and started to be influenced by peers to exaggerate sports from academics. 
      Therefore, my performance in academics dropped sharply while my performance in sports can be said to remain good.</p>

      whether I went to school in the morning or evening (religious school).</p>
